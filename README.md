# Programming Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about the **Most Streamed Spotify Songs of 2023**. The goal is to analyze, visualize, and interpret the data to extract meaningful insights regarding popular tracks, artists, and musical trends.

The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle: [Top Spotify Songs 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023).

## General Guidelines

The analysis includes:
1. **Data Exploration**: Checking for missing values, data types, and understanding the dataset structure.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics for key metrics like streams, release dates, and musical attributes (e.g., BPM, danceability).
3. **Visualizations**: Creating visual representations like bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to identify trends and patterns.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating relationships between different musical characteristics (e.g., streams vs. tempo, energy).
5. **Insights & Recommendations**: Drawing conclusions about popular tracks, artists, and trends based on the data.

## Key Questions Answered

1. **Overview of the Dataset**:
   - How many rows and columns does the dataset have?
   - What are the data types of each column, and are there any missing values?

2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - What are the mean, median, and standard deviation for the streams column?
   - What is the distribution of release years and artist counts?

3. **Top Performers**:
   - Which track has the highest number of streams? Display the top 5 most streamed tracks.
   - Who are the top 5 most frequent artists based on track count?

4. **Temporal Trends**:
   - Analyzing track release trends over time.
   - Identifying which month has the most releases.

5. **Genre and Music Characteristics**:
   - Correlation between streams and attributes like BPM, danceability, and energy.
   - Correlation between attributes like danceability vs. energy, and valence vs. acousticness.

6. **Platform Popularity**:
   - Comparison of tracks in Spotify playlists, Spotify charts, and Apple playlists.

7. **Advanced Analysis**:
   - Patterns among tracks with the same key or mode (Major vs. Minor).
   - Genre or artist patterns in appearing frequently on playlists or charts.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data handling.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To organize and present the analysis.

## Results & Insights

Key insights drawn from the analysis include:
- Trends in streaming numbers.
- Popularity patterns among tracks and artists.
- Correlations between musical features and stream counts.
